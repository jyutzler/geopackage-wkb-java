# GeoPackage WKB Java

#### GeoPackage Well Known Binary Lib ####

The [GeoPackage Libraries](http://ngageoint.github.io/GeoPackage/) were developed at the [National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA)](http://www.nga.mil/) in collaboration with [BIT Systems](http://www.bit-sys.com/). The government has "unlimited rights" and is releasing this software to increase the impact of government investments by providing developers with the opportunity to take things in new directions.

### About ###

[WKB](http://ngageoint.github.io/geopackage-wkb-java/) is a Java library for writing and reading Well-Known Binary Geometries to and from bytes. The library includes a hierarchy of Geometry objects. Although developed as part of the [GeoPackage Libraries](http://ngageoint.github.io/GeoPackage/), this library does not contain GeoPackage functionality and can be used separately.

#### Read ####

```java

//byte[] bytes = ...    

ByteReader reader = new ByteReader(bytes);
reader.setByteOrder(ByteOrder.BIG_ENDIAN);
Geometry geometry = WkbGeometryReader.readGeometry(reader);
GeometryType geometryType = geometry.getGeometryType();

```

#### Write ####

```java

//Geometry geometry = ...

ByteWriter writer = new ByteWriter();
writer.setByteOrder(ByteOrder.BIG_ENDIAN);
WkbGeometryWriter.writeGeometry(writer, geometry);
byte[] bytes = writer.getBytes();
writer.close();

```
